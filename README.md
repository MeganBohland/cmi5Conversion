# convertClassesWork
A repo to hold my work and new files as I break these classes down

## How to use
Currently this is set so that HTML courses can be convertered. It hooks into the existing buttons and features, to listen and send cmi5 statements. The course currently in the rpoe is Combating Trafficking in Persons (CTIP). 

Ideally to utilize all that will be needed is the HTML course to be broken apart and the HTML tweaked. For some reason the Moodle upload doesn't function unless it is broken up like this:

cmi5.xml (this will need to be created and point to the correct html pages for each AU)
CourseConverter.js
CourseFiles - 
 - css folder
Image folder
Video Folder
Javascript Folder
    - besides other js files, include Rustici's course_cmi5.js
