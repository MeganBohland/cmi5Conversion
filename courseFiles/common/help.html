	    Use the Next Lesson tab when you've finished a lesson and are ready to advance to the next lesson in the course. Some courses do not allow learners to continue past incomplete lessons.</p>
		<p><strong>Course Tree</strong><br />
	    The course tree displays the lessons and your progress. Open folders can be collapsed. Closed folders can be expanded. Completed lessons will have a green checkmark. Incomplete lessons will have a half-filled circle. Some courses prevent you from advancing past incomplete lessons. Unviewed lessons will have an open circle.</p>
		<p><strong>Suspend Tab</strong><br />
	    Use the Suspend tab to bookmark your current progress in the course.</p>
		<p><strong>Help Tab</strong><br />
	    The Help tab recalls the course description and its terminal learning objective, as well as a description of the Learning Management System (LMS) and its navigational elements. </p>

	    The Exit Course tab will close the active window. To resume the course, re-launch it from the My Training tab in the JKO LMS and then select the Resume tab at the top of the window. Courses have bookmarking and will resume from the last lesson viewed. If you have completed the course, you can view its certificate by selecting the Certificates tab in the JKO LMS.</p>

	    The Hide TOC (table of contents) tab will close the course tree to the left of the main window. While the course tree is closed, the Hide TOC tab becomes an Open TOC tab.</p>
